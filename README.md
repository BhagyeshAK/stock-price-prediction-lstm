# stock-price-prediction-lstm
Predict future stock prices using LSTM and technical indicators (MA, RSI)
ðŸ“Œ Project Description

- Developed a *stock price prediction model* using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
- Used **real historical stock data** from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` API.
- Preprocessed and normalized data to prepare for deep learning model training.
- Trained an LSTM model to learn *time-series patterns* and forecast future prices.
- Included technical indicators:
  - *Moving Average (MA20)* â€“ to smooth price trends.
  - *Relative Strength Index (RSI)* â€“ to detect overbought/oversold conditions.
- Visualized actual vs predicted prices for performance comparison.
- Project designed for **educational purposes**, showcasing how ML can be used in financial forecasting.
- (Optional) Ready to deploy as an *interactive Streamlit dashboard*.
